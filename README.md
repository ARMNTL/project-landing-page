## How I made this landing page

I used VSCode for Windows.

### Let get started

1. Open VSCode
2. File > Open Folder...
3. Navigate to your projects folder
4. New Folder with your project's name
5. Select Folder to open it in VSCode
6. File > New File...
7. Name it `index.html`
8. File > New File...
9. Name it `styles.css`

> Alternatively, you can use the CLI
>
> 1. Open your CLI
> 2. `cd` into your project's folder
> 3. `mkdir my-project-name`
> 4. `cd my-projct-name`
> 5. `touch index.html styles.css`
> 6. `code .`

10. In `index.html` type `!` and enter for the boilerplate
11. Change the title
12. Add `<link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />` under the title

> This would be a good time to make your initial commit
